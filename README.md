# AgriScan

Deep Learning based Web App for Detection of Plant Diseases (SDG #2)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

NPM, PIP, MongoDB to install all dependencies
Also hosted on Heroku agriscan.herokuapp.com

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

Web Frameworks:
Express.js
Bootstrap
Multer
NodeJS
MongoDB
JS
HTML5
CSS3
PUGJS
VUEJS

Python Libraries:
gunicorn
numpy
fastai
torch

View the Jupyter Notebook for the DL application on the third link provided in the project submission 
to see how the neural network processes data and its accuracy.

Uses a JS to Python connector to run the CNN's python model scripts.

### Installing

Run MongoDB community edition server
Run on http://localhost:8080 or using the heroku link provided.
Say what the step will be

```
npm install
```

### Facebook Technlogies Used

```
flow - vs code extension, type checking JS
pytorch - for training the deep learning network
```
